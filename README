Due Date: Week 13

* Update: 06 April 2024. Base game is complete. Now we focus on the "More Credits" Part:

    1. If a cell with no surrounding mine is revealed, all the 8-neighbors shall be automatically revealed, in a "recursive" manner. Also, there is no need to display the number "0". [DONE]
    2. Reset/Restart the game. 
    3. Beautify your graphical interface, e.g., theme (color, font), layout, etc.
    4. Choice of difficulty levels (e.g,, easy, intermediate, difficult with different board sizes).
    5. Create a menu bar for options such as "File" ("New Game", "Reset Game", "Exit"), "Options", and "Help" (Use JMenuBar, JMenu, and JMenuItem classes).
    6. Create a status bar (JTextField at the south zone of BorderLayout) to show the messages (e.g., the number of mines remaining). (Google "java swing statusbar").
    7. Timer (pause/resume), score, progress bar.
    8. A side panel for command, display, strategy?
    9. Choice of game board - there are many variations of game board!
    10. Sound effect, background music, enable/disable sound?
    11. High score and player name?
    12. Hints and cheats?
    13. Theme?
    14. Use of images and icons?
    15. Welcome screen?
    16. Mouse-less interface?
    17. Handling of first move: Most minesweepers ensure that your first move will not hit a mine? Some even ensure that the first move will always has 0 surrounding mines.
    18. (Very difficult) Multi-Player network game.
