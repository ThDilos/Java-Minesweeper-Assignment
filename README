[Official Assignment Guideline](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/JavaGame_MineSweeper.html)

* Update: 06 April 2024. Base game is complete. Now we focus on the "More Credits" Part:

    1. If a cell with no surrounding mine is revealed, all the 8-neighbors shall be automatically revealed, in a "recursive" manner. Also, there is no need to display the number "0". [DONE]
    2. Reset/Restart the game. [DONE]
    3. Beautify your graphical interface, e.g., theme (color, font), layout, etc. [To be done at last?]
    4. Choice of difficulty levels (e.g,, easy, intermediate, difficult with different board sizes). [DONE]
    5. Create a menu bar for options such as "File" ("New Game", "Reset Game", "Exit"), "Options", and "Help" (Use JMenuBar, JMenu, and JMenuItem classes). [I don't suggest this, this makes the game look old and ugly :(]
    6. Create a status bar (JTextField at the south zone of BorderLayout) to show the messages (e.g., the number of mines remaining). (Google "java swing statusbar").
    7. Timer (pause/resume), score, progress bar. [Timer DONE]
    8. A side panel for command, display, strategy? 
    9. Choice of game board - there are many variations of game board!
    10. Sound effect, background music, enable/disable sound?
    11. High score and player name? [DONE (Locally)]
    12. Hints and cheats? 
    13. Theme?
    14. Use of images and icons?
    15. Welcome screen? [Start Menu?] [DONE]
    16. Mouse-less interface? [Why do we even need this] [Possible but a lot of work]
    17. Handling of first move: Most minesweepers ensure that your first move will not hit a mine? Some even ensure that the first move will always has 0 surrounding mines. [Done]
    18. (Very difficult) Multi-Player network game. [I don't think we have enough time for this] [ I Tried to do a simple cloud ranking, managed to get MySQL Database & tables and PHPMyAdmin setup and working in my vps, but the java side seems more complicated, and the users must also have a JDBC driver? nah not worth it ]
    ......

* Update: 07 April 2024. The next few updates should be in branch V1.0.1

2. A status bar with timer, restart and go back to menu button
3. Start Page
